# 🗳️ Simple Voting System in C

This project is a simple command-line voting program written in C.  
It allows users to enter a list of candidates, collect votes from multiple voters, and finally display the election results with the winner (or declare a tie).  

# 📌 Features

Add any number of candidates.

Collect votes from multiple voters.

Prevents invalid votes (votes outside the candidate range).

Displays total votes received by each candidate.

Declares the winner or announces a tie.

# ⚙️ How It Works

The program asks for the number of candidates.  

You enter the names of the candidates.  

You specify the number of voters.  

Each voter casts their vote by entering the corresponding number for their chosen candidate.    

The program shows the vote count per candidate and the winner (or tie).   

# 🚀 Example Run  

  Welcome to the voting program.  
  
Enter the number of candidates: 3  
Enter the names of the candidates:  
Candidate 1: Alice

The voting result is tied.  
The voting program has ended.
